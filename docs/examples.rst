Nengo creates these models using the principles of the
`Neural Engineering Framework <http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/nef.html>`_.
The first set of examples explains these three principles:
*representation*, *transformation*, and *dynamics*.

For a summary of these principles, see the following example:

.. toctree::

   examples/nef_summary

The following examples give a more detailed presentation:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   representation
   transformation
   dynamics

Putting these three principles together allows us to scale
these examples up to larger networks that do more complex functions.
